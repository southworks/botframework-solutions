## Validate the Skill manifest endpoint

- To validate your Skill is deployed and working open up a browser window and navigate to your deployed Skill manifest (`/api/skill/manifest endpoint`). e.g.  `http://localhost:3978/api/skill/manifest`

## Adding your skill to an assistant

To add your new Skill to your assistant we provide the [botskills](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botskills) command line tool to automate the process of adding the skill to your dispatch model and creating authentication connections where needed. 

Run the following command from a command prompt **within the directory of your assistant/Bot**. 

```bash
botskills connect --remoteManifest "http://<YOUR_SKILL_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/skill/manifest" --ts
```
